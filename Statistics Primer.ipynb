    "In this session we're going to grapple with two new challenges: (1) programming in Python and (2) statistics. Thankfully (1) is extremely straightforward because you will just be *running* code, rather than writing it. (2) Is where we will need to focus our efforts. It is worth this dedication, though, because without a good understanding of the relevant statistical concepts, understanding of extreme events (which are the critical drivers of *risk*) is difficult to say the least. \n",

    "We will address these learning objectives by following this \"Jupyter Notebook\": an interactive story, with normal text in some places (like in this 'cell'), and Python computer code elsewhere (like below). To make the most of this resource, you must indeed *treat it like a story* -- read everything in the order it's presented, and run the code when told to do so. It is fine to work with one of your coursemates to discuss the notebook as you progress. I also encourage you to ask me (Tom) questions if you get stuck or want to know more. \n",

    "The answer to this should be quite obvious after a moment's pause. We have, by definition, excluded 2 % of the population with our design standard (i.e., 1 in 50 women). 2 % of 500,000 is 10,000: this is how many scientists would need a custom chair. \n",

    "Why am I labouring this relatively obvious point? Because this general approach -- where we have a *sample* of data and must deduce some quantitiy relating to the *entire population* -- is common. Note that here, our *sample* is 1,000 strong, and the population comprises 500,000 individuals. We used the sample to compute the percentiles and then used that (which we implicitly assume represents *all* female scientists) to infer something about that wider population. \n",

They do not want to exclude 2 women in every hundred (or 1 in 50), and instead want to exclude only 1 in every 2,000. To make things a bit simpler, design innovations mean the chair is only limted in the upper-range of heights it can fit; we therefore only need to identify a new upper bound to inform the chair's design (the height equalled or *exceeded* by 1 in 2,000 women).  \n",

    "To be clear on these issues of syntax at this stage, though: a value equalled or exceeded 1 in 2,000 trials has a probability of being equalled or exceeded of 1/2,000 = 0.0005 (or 0.05 %) on any one individual trial; there is consequently a 100-0.05 = 99.95 % chance of *not* being equalled/exceeded on any trial (the *\"non-exceedance probability\"*). The value that corresponds to this rarity is the 99.95th percentile and has a *return period* of 1/0.0005 = 2,000 trials. \"Trials\" means individuals in the context of heights we're working with here; but it often means a unit of time in climate science (for example, days or years).  \n",

    "If you're having trouble spotting the difference between the red and blue curves, that's no surpise. As with the comparison between $p(x)$ and the histogram, we note that the match is very close because our sample of heights is quite large (1,000 members) and is drawn from a normal distribution. Had our sample been smaller, it is more likely that our empirical estimate of non-exceedance probability would look a little different -- even if drawn from the same normal distribution. Why? Well, broadly speaking, the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) indicates that probabilities converge on their \"expected\" values with a sufficiently large number of trials.

In the case of the normal distribution, we need to quantify two paramaters: the mean and standard deviation; but some other distributions require additional paramaters to be set. Both of these \"challenges\" exist because we must *estimate* both the distribution *and* its paramaters from a finite sample. As I hope is intuitive from the example above, the larger the sample, the closer we should get to the right answer.
