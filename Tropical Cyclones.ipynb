    "# Tropical Cyclones\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    " \n",
    "We are now ready to consider the biggest beast of them all when it comes to weather/climate hazards. Over the next few sessions, we will be working on *tropical cyclones* -- namely, the risk they currently pose (or, rather, have historically posed), and how this may change under climate warming. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the term *risk* there was not accidental. We will be going beyond simpy assessing the hazard; we will be estimating impact as measured through total finanical losses (normalised to 2018 USD [$] to account for inflation). \n",
    "\n",
    "To work through these important concepts, we will be following a hypothetical scenario, outlined below, in which the US Treasury have hired you and your team as experts in tropical cyclone risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to summarise the potential financial impact of tropical cyclones over the next 100 years. They have asked you to assess: \n",
    "\n",
    "[1] The expected annual cost of tropical cyclones to the USA, assuming no further climate change. \n",
    "\n",
    "[2] The cost of a very expensive (i.e., rare) year -- again in a stationary climate. The Treasury define this as a year with costs exceeded in no more than 1 % % of years: the one-in-100-year cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "[3] How climate change may affect the risk\n",
    "\n",
    "You should address the requests of the Treasury by working through the steps in this Notebook, operating in pairs/teams if you desire (but no more than three to a group). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working estimates of tropical cyclone damage from [ICAT](http://www.icatdamageestimator.com/viewdata). All costs are provided in US Dollars, adjusted for inflation to 2018 equaivalent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When assessing the role of climate change, you will be using data from the [ERA5 reanalysis](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5), combined with a [model](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/2351/2021/) to estimate the maximum potential intensity of tropical cyclones as a function of changes to sea surface temperature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the workbook to address the requests of the Treasury. Remember to run code cells when you get to them by either pressing \"run\" at the of the browser window, or by hitting \"ctrl\" + \"enter\" on your keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first code cell (below) sets the notebook up for analysis. It also summarises the economic impacts from past hurricanes, printing the mean losses per year and per hurricane. The top ten years (by cost) are printed, and the most costly year is identified. Run this first code cell now. "

    "To put the magnitude of variability into perspective, the maximum annual bill (\\\\$265 billion) is not too far short of 100 times larger than the median value ($3 billion). If such variability existed in human heights, we should expect to encounter people well over 200 m tall! The possibility of such large \"events\" can make the mean *very* sensitive to sampling variability. To appreciate this, imagine calculating the mean height of all people in this room -- hoping it's a representative sample of all students on campus -- and then picture how that would change if a ~200 m tall student accidentally (tried) to pop in; your mean would go up -- a lot! \n",
    "\n",
    "We would be on a much firmer footing to compute the expected value if we knew the statistical distribution of the *population* (of heights, in this example). Knowing the population distribution is equivalent to being able to measure the heights of *all* students on campus. However, seldom can me measure all \"members\" of a population, so we instead make an assumption about the *probability distribution* (e.g., the Normal, GEV, etc.,) that represents the population, and use the properties of *that* to compute things like the expected value and, for eample, the probability of values beyond given thresholds (via the *CDF* -- as discussed in previous weeks).\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be very helpful, then, to compute the expected value from the probability distribution that represents *annual costs*. We'll get into that soon; first, let's deal with a slightly simpler question: what does the distribution of *costs per cyclone* look like?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The distribution of cyclone impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we're breaking things down like this is because, when you think on the processes for a little bit, it makes sense to deal with the damage per cyclone *seperately* from the number of cylones per year. The conceptual basis is explained in [Katz (2002)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/41/7/1520-0450_2002_041_0754_smohd_2.0.co_2.xml), but one intuitive reason to seperate them is because the annual cost can equal **exactly** zero (a year in which no damaging hurricanes make landfall), *or **any** other amount*, so our final statistical model must be capable of predicting exactly zero damages, *and* any other amount -- both with the right frequency. For this reason (and some others) it turns out separating our statistical approach into models (distributions) that deal with cyclone occurrence (number of storms per year), from those which consider impact (the cost per storm), is a good idea. So, with that explainer out the way, let's get back to assessing the distribution of costs per hurricane. Run the code to take a look. "

    "## Climate Change\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to tackle the thorny issue of climate warming: how *may* the cost of tropical cyclone impacts change? The approach we will take here is simple: take the weather conditions observed during the very costly 2005 hurricane season, and then \"add on\" some climate warming -- an amount of our choosing -- to see what impact this could have on tropical cyclone maximum intensity. We compute maximum potential intensity using a [simple model](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/2351/2021/) that works out how powerful a cyclone could get, given the atmospheric state. Computing the % change in the 99th percentile of potential intensities (communicated in terms of maximum sustained wind speeds) -- between 2005 and our warmer climate -- enables use to estimate how strong tropical cyclones are likely to change with warming. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we translate this increase in intensity to a change in economic impacts? A [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9be2) in the Western Pacific provides us with a simple rule of thumb: if wind speed increases by a factor of $x$, economic losses increase by a factor or $x^{1.70}$. We will use that here, but let's be clear: it is a rather crude approximation, and provides no more that a first approximation of potential impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to summarise, we work out how much intensity (the 99th percentile of maximum wind speed) is likely to change in a climate $n$ degrees warmer than 2005 (call this factor $x$); and we then compute $x^{1.70}$ to evaluate the increase in economic damages. For example, if $x$ = 1.25 for a climate state ($n$) = 2$^{\\circ}$C warmer than 2005, the increase in economic damage (relative to 2005) would be by a factor of 1.25$^{1.70}$ = 1.46 = 46%\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this analysis, then, we must first compute the 99th percentile of maximum wind speed in the *reference* (2005) climate. Run the code below to do this; the result will print to screen. "

    "#### What did we do? \n",
    "Under a scenario of responding to a request from the US Treasury, we summarised the *observed* economic impacts from hurricanes making landfall in the USA. We then assessed the statistical distributions of the impact per hurricane (the Log-Normal), and the number of hurricanes per year (Poisson). We used a simple formula to compute the expected hurricane cost per year using paramaters from the the Log-Normal and Poisson distributions. To evaluate the expected magnitude of the 1-in-100-year hurricane season, we then used a \"*stochastic simulation*\" (i.e., the random sampling from the Poisson and Log-Normal distributions). The role of climate change was assessed by scaling impacts by an amount that depended on the increase in maximum potential intensity -- which we assessed by ramping up sea surface temperature (relative to 2005) and applying a simple model to estimate how this would affect hurricane winds. \n",

    "How would you respond?\n",
