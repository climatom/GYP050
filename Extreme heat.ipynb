    "# <center> Workshop 2: Extreme Heat</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we're going to build on the Statistics Primer and investigate changes to extreme \"heat\" as a function of global warming. Specifically, the aims of this session are to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Consolidate understanding of \"humid\" heat and associated metrics\n",
    "- Explore statistical methods for estimating the impact of climate change on the frequency of extreme heat events\n",
    "- Consider climate change \"attribution\" \n",
    "- Begin thinking more concretely about the human impacts from extreme heat events\n",
    " \n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics \n",
    "In our last workshop -- the Statistics Primer -- we explored how *probability distributions* can be used to estimate the probability of an *'event'* (e.g., a person's height or meteorological extreme) exceeding a given threshold $x$. This \"exceedance probability\" is given by 1-*CDF($x$)*, where *CDF* is the cumulative distribution function, and 1/(1-*CDF($x$)*) is the return period (noting that *CDF* is a fraction here -- 0-1, rather than 0-100%). In this session, we will be building on this understanding to evaluate how rare given heat extremes are in the current climate, and seeing how this changes as the global climate warms. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on extreme heat\n",
    "In the lecture, we discussed some key aspects of extreme humid heat. The links below provide accessible overviews of the big-picture concerns and directions of travel. Please read them before continuing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [A deadly upper limit to extreme heat](https://theconversation.com/global-warming-now-pushing-heat-into-territory-humans-cannot-tolerate-138343)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Where is the hottest place on Earth?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nL0L8owZXXnxiinZ4hoUBVPIJFUt4HE_/view?usp=sharing) \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will be using a metric called the \"modified discomfort index\" (the \"mdi\"). It is a simple weighted average of the wet-bulb (weight=0.75) and dry-bulb (weight=0.3) air temperatures. It is therefore a measure that captures the extent of *humid* heat. **Note that the mdi is *very* similar to the widely used \"wet-bulb globe temperature (WGBT)\"**. The only difference is that WBGT uses a weight of 0.7 (rather than 0.75) for the wet-bulb temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of today's work, a **very important* threshold in the mdi is a value of 37.8$^{\\circ}$C**. Emerging research indicates that this is a better indicator of the upper-limit to human heat tolerance than the 35$^{\\circ}$C wet-bulb threshold, so we will use it here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Case study \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using 1981-2020 annual maximum mdi data computed from three-hourly [ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview) data for the city of [Larkana, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkana). \n",
    "\n",
    "How hot does it get in Larkana? Let's begin our analysis by finding out: we will start by ploting the annnual maxima mdi time series. "

    "\n",
    "Today, we will be evaluating how rare exceedances of the mdi are above given thresholds (including 37.8$^{\\circ}$C) under different climates, by evaluating the *CDF* of a probability distribution that fits the observed values well (i.e., that we think represents the *population*). Knowing how to selecting this correct distribution is a little beyond the scope of our session, but some guidance is covered in Chapter 4 of the [Wilks textbook](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/lboro/reader.action?docID=689817). Here, we will assume that the [generalized extreme value distribution - 'GEV'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution) is the parent population, as is [often the case for annual maximum heat indices](https://ascmo.copernicus.org/articles/6/177/2020/). \n",

    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why we're querying 34.8$^{\\circ}$C -- 3$^{\\circ}$C below the important 37.8$^{\\circ}$C threshold. The reason is that a GEV distribution with a negative shape paramater has 'support' for values above negative infinity (so no problem there) but below μ − σ / ξ. In this case, that's 34.13 -0.42/-0.47 = 35.02, meaning 35.02$^{\\circ}$C is the theoretical upper limit of support. That means, according to the GEV distribution, values above that can be regarded as (statistically) impossible. Interestingly, [emerging research](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-20-0916.1/JCLI-D-20-0916.1.xml) is suggesting that upper bounds found in this way may also be physically plausible. For now, just appreciate that we're not querying he probability of 37.8$^{\\circ}$C because the GEV we fitted indicates that this would be impossble -- it's beyond the upper bound of 35.02$^{\\circ}$C. \n"

    "Intuitively, we would expect this upward trend in the mdi to mean that the probability of the mdi exceeding a given threshold has increased with time (or, equivalently, with global warming amount). For example, we would expect that the return period of a 34.8$^{\\circ}$C event would be smaller in 2020 (which was, globally, around 0.9C above pre-industrial), than it was in 1981 (0.25$^{\\circ}$C above pre-industrial). \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can account for this *non-stationarity* with our definition of the GEV distribution. We can make the *location* parameter a function of global mean air temperature. In essence, this allows us to shift the distribution to the right (i.e., to higher values). In the code below, we make the *location* paramater a simple linear *function* of global mean warming amount:\n",

    "Don't worry too much about how the values of $\\beta_{1}$ $\\beta_{2}$ are determined, but the quick answer is that there's an algorithm behind the scenes that tries to find the best match to our data. Technically, we're trying to find the paramater values that \"maximize the likelihood\" of observing our mdi values. You can read about this also in Chapter 4 of the [Wilks textbook](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/lboro/reader.action?docID=689817). To help gain an intuition for the most important bits, though, note that the amount the *PDF* is \"shifted\" (by adjusting the scale), is set by $\\beta_{1}$, which in turn depends on how sensitive the mdi was to changes in global mean air temperature during the 1981-2020 period. In the fitting conducted in the code below, we find that the location paramater changes (i.e., shifts right) by 0.7$^{\\circ}$C for every 1$^{\\circ}$C of global warmng. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can test whether a non-stationary skew normal distribution is an improvement over the stationary skew normal  by evaluating the [Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) for both distributions. The lower the AIC, the better the distribution -- even when accounting for (penalising) increasing complexity. More on the AIC -- and non-stationarity in extremes -- can be found in [Slater et al.

    "## Summary\n",
    "OK. We've covered quite a lot of new ground here, so let's recap. \n",
    "\n",
    "We fitted a skew normal distribution to our 40-year sample of annual maximum mdi (1981-2020). We used this distribution to illustratively compute the exceedance probability (and return period) for an mdi of at least 35$^{\\circ}$C, obtaining a result of 1.2 % (~85 years). \n",
    "\n",
    "We provisioned for the impact of climate warming by making the skew normal distribution non-stationary, allowing the location parameter to move with global warming amount. The amount the location shifted per degree of global warming (0.8$^{\\circ}$C) was determined by the historical relationship between annual maximum mdi and changes in global mean air temperature. We found the value for this parameter (and for all paramaters in the distributions used) by maximising the likelihood of observing our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-stationary distribution could then be used to evaluate the exceedance probability of a given mdi value for any scenario of warming. Some more examples of this type of analysis being used to assess changes in the probability of extremes -- in the context of *attribution* can be read about in [Oldenborgh et al. (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03071-7) and [Philip et al. (2021)](https://ascmo.copernicus.org/articles/6/177/2020/) \n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of this approach is that at no point did we use a climate model to infer future changes to extreme heat. Instead our approach simply assumed that the past relationship between global mean air temperature and annual maximum mdi in Larkana will remain unchanged as the climate warms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an important simplifcation to our analysis was that we did not assess the impact of [sampling error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_error) on our estimated paramaters. Doing so would have provided us with a *range* of likely exceedance probabilities/return periods for all the mdi thresholds and warming amounts we queried.  \n",
